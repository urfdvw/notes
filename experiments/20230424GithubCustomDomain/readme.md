# link domain to github page
ref
- https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/
- use the "APEX domain" (the one without www)
    - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23184
    - www one will be redirected to this one.
- will need to wait for a few hours to have it fully settle down
- check the enforce https in github page setting

# issues
The domain is blocked by some firewall, removed the original link.
The short link is used to auto jump to the original git hub link
